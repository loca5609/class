			<strong>Step 1: LCD Setup</strong><br/>
			The first thing that we want to do is get the LCD powered from the breadboard. 
			First connect the 5v+ to positive rail of the breadboard and the GND pin to the negative rail.
			Place the LCD on the board in a way you can access all the pins easily.
			Connect pin 1 of the LCD to the 5v+ rail and pin 2 to the ground rail.<br/>
			Connect pin 15 of the LCD to the 5v+ rail and pin 16 to the ground rail as well. <br/>
			Connect pin 5 to the ground rail. This will put the LCD into write mode always. If you wanted to both write to the screen and read from the screen
			you can always wire pin 5 to an Arduino pin and pull it high or low depending on the mode you want. <br/>
			
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Step 2: Potentiometer</strong><br/>
			Take your 3 pin potentiometer and wire the first pin to the positive rail and the third pin to the negative rail.
			The second pin is the signal pin and needs to be wired to pin 3 of the LCD. If your LCD is powered right you should be able to
			turn the knob and see the brightness of the LCD increase or decrease.<br/>

			<strong>Step 3: Wiring to Arduino</strong><br/>
			Its now time to wire the enable pin and the 4 data pins that will send the binary signal to the LCD for display. <br/>
			<ul>
				<li>D4 LCD pin to Arduino pin 5</li>
				<li>D5 LCD pin to Arduino pin 4</li>
				<li>D6 LCD pin to Arduino pin 3</li>
				<li>D7 LCD pin to Arduino pin 2</li>
			</ul>

			The final result should look like this.
